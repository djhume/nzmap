nzmap
=====

Example NZ map (javascript/d3/TOPOjson).

d3/svg regions loosely based on Grid Exit Points (GXPs) supplied area through NSP/ICP mapping.

Regional mappings supplied by Electricity Authority.  Real Time Price data obtained from wits.

Currently svg mappings are based on GXP regions (out-dated) where a GXP is mapped to individual NSP/ICPs.

With updated wits data (every five minutes), can be used to plot real-time spot prices in the NZ Electricity market.
